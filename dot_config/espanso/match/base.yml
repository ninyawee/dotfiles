# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espanso/espanso/dev/schemas/match.schema.json

# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: "dnm "
    replace: "don't modify anything yet"

  - trigger: "cse "
    replace: "the currently selected element "

  - trigger: "wwr "
    replace: "what went wrong? investigate the issue don't modify anything yet"

  - trigger: "pto "
    replace: "plan things out, do not implement yet"

  - trigger: "dpto "
    replace: "think deeply, plan things out, do not implement yet"

  - trigger: "iit "
    replace: "it is there. no need to do it again."

  - trigger: "stp "
    replace: "please skip this process"

  - trigger: "pls "
    replace: "please "

  - trigger: "Pls "
    replace: "Please "

  - trigger: "nvm "
    replace: "never mind ☺️ "

  - trigger: "Fyi "
    replace: "For your information, "

  - trigger: "fyi "
    replace: "For your information, "

  - trigger: "Imo "
    replace: "In my opinion, "

  - trigger: "imo "
    replace: "In my opinion, "

  - trigger: "Tbh "
    replace: "To be honest, "

  - trigger: "idsat "
    replace: "I don't see any takes here. "

  - trigger: "cye "
    replace: "can you explain? "

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date/"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y/%m/%d"

  - trigger: ":date-"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
